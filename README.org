* ~init.el~ and friends

Just a copy of my simple emacs config that I use daily, tested in
~emacs-v30~. Focused on ~C~ stuff, ~LaTeX~ academic writting and
~org-mode~.  This is just a personal ~.file~, do not expect something
amazing when cloning this repo. You may need to install the [[https://github.com/Echinoidea/Aporetic-Nerd-Font][Aporetic
Nerd Font]]. Check ~init.el~ for other things you may need to install
outside Emacs, like ~texlive-full~, ~git~ or ~lsp~.
